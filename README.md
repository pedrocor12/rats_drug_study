# Study of Weibull Distribution against a Normal distribution

### Comparing if the treatment had an impact of on the weight of the mice 

#### Report :


The sample data for the study was randomly generated using two continuous probability distributions:
• Normal Distribution for the mice datasets, and as followed by the specification I carefully square 
rooted the variance value as rnorm takes the standard deviation as one of the parameters.
• Weibull Distribution for the rats. The parameters which define this distribution are the scale and 
shape which I have set according to the specification.
The following qplot and boxplot have been formulated from the sample data of the mice using the ggplot 
package:
